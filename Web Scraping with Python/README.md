- This code is just to test some functions shown by the book. The accessed site is the same as the book.

> Cap 3

- The informations to be collected using this code used the website <q><a href="https://www.finn.no/job/fulltime/search.html?sort=RELEVANCE">finn.no</a></q> on jobs part. The first attempt was getting all job links and store in a list. To check if everthing was right I just shown the links on screen

- The practise code is a bit more complex because instead of only store the link founded it will access that link and get the Title and the First Paragraph. The first idea was put that data in a dict() but this will demand more than the necessary for the progress and it will slow the code a bit.

> Cap 4

- In this script I not only get the Title but also get the Location to put them together in a dict() that the location is the Key and the Title is the Value. More visualisation progress were added to know how many links were collected and how many were accessed properly. At the end the dictionary is shown and how long is takes to get all data from the first page.

    - <sup>The time still too high for me and I'm planning in the future add a thread funtion that access the link while the code add them in the list, or after all links were added access all of them at the same time, this will reduce quite the time as there are more than 25k links to visit.</sup>

- This script has more defined function but all that functions do specific little things to become more easier to maintain it.

- The updated version had just some improvements to be written in fewer lines than the first version.
