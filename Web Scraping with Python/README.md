> Cap 3

- The informations to be collected using this code used the website <q>finn.no</q> on jobs part. The first attempt was getting all job links and store in a list. To check if everthing was right I just shown the links on screen

- The practise code is a bit more complex because instead of only store the link founded it will access that link and get the Title and the First Paragraph. The first idea was put that data in a dict() but this will demand more than the necessary for the progress and it will slow the code a bit.
